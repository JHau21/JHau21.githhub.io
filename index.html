								Welcome! My name is Jack Hau and I am a
								Computer Science major with a minor in
								Creative Technology and Design and my
								pronouns are he/him/his. Most of my life
								I've been interested in STEM and
								specifically engineering. Freshman Year
								of college, I became very passionate
								about programming in general, finding
								that every coding assignment felt like a
								puzzle game. I quickly fell in love with
								my major and Sophomore Year secured a
								job as a Full-Stack Developer. I spent
								about a year doing web and mobile
								development and it was an extremely
								enjoyable. Given my positive experience,
								I quickly developed in interest in
								exploring everything in computer and
								recently secured a job working with Data
								Backup and Security, as well as
								Networks. I am extremely eager to see
								where Computer Science takes me and I'm
								always looking to learn something new!

								School and university at the University

								few notable awards. I had perfect
								attendance when I graduated, was a

								tutored students in other class, and
								made Honor Roll every semester. At
								university I currently have a 3.75 GPA,
								have made the Dean's List three times,
								and managed a 4.0 GPA two of my
								semesters. I am also the VP of
								Administration and a founding father of
								my fraternity. In terms of my work, I
								spent about 3 months as a Receptionist
								at Roosters when I was 16, worked for
								about 3 years as an Tire-Technician at
								Discount Tire, and spent about a year as
								a Full-Stack Developer at Showingly.

							Hobbies and Interests
						</h4>
						<p class="contentFontTextGeneral contentText">
							Outside of work my most common and consistent
							hobby is weight lifting. I've become heavily
							invested in various forms of weight lifting
							and spend 6-days-a-week, 2-hours-a-day in the
							gym doing a hybrid of body building and
							powerlifting. In the summer I spend quite a
							bit of time outdoors hiking and especially
							enjoy climbing 14ers, having climbed 9 now.
							In the winter I ski whenever I can find
							freetime, usually around 10 times per year.
							Besides my more athletic hobbies, I tend to
							spend the rest of my freetime playing a lot
							of video games!
