    <p style="font-family: sans-serif">
        My name is Jack Hau and I am a Computer Science major with a minor in
        Creative Technology and Design and my pronouns are he/him/his.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif">
        I've done quite a bit of Software Development over the last year and a
        half and have grown very passionate about it. I am hoping to learn some
        new HTML, CSS, and Javascript tricks in this course and gain some more
        knowledge of web development. In my freetime you can usually find me
        lifting weights, but I am also very passionate about hiking and skiing. I
        also am involved in a fraternity, being the VP of Administration and am
        currently developing a website for my Mom's business, as well as an SMS
        API to help me with my fraternity position!
